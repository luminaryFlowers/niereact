# NieReact

About half a year ago, I'd made a NieR:Automata themed website for my personal Twitter account to use in place of a 
Carrd. I was happy with how it looked, but the source code wasn't very good. I learned how to use React in a group 
project, liked it, and then figured I should remake the website but with React, and also with an easier to modify
JSON file. Now you, too, can have a cool NieR website! *Wow!!!!!!!!*
