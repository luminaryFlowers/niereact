# NieReact

About half a year ago, I'd made a NieR:Automata themed website for my personal Twitter account to use in place of a 
Carrd. I was happy with how it looked, but the source code wasn't very good. I learned how to use React in a group 
project, liked it, and then figured I should remake the website but with React, and also with an easier to modify
JSON file. Now you, too, can have a cool NieR website! *Wow!!!!!!!!*

Please check the tutorial/showcase website for more information!! There's a guide and everything. [Click here to go to it!](https://tortoisetea.github.io/niereact/)

Below is some extras.

### What I learned

- I got some neat extra experience with React. I figured out how to do fade-in/out transitions with replacing objects and such, which I didn't know how to do before, though it's not particularly difficult! I also had been using classes with React components before, whereas I used functions here. I like how functions are a lot simpler and cleaner, but I miss how easy states are with classes. I'll probably use functions from here on out.

- I also figured out how to "dynamically" import images, because the results from Google were a lot of people arguing and very little of people saying how to do it!!! It took a bit but you mostly only ever need to learn something once, I think. :)

- I think I like web development, and I like looking at the finished website! Even if CSS steals my lunch money and makes me cry sometimes!
